## Mechanistic Machine Learning

After all the data pouring, attention to causal inference and mechanistic models is coming back^[@bakerMechanisticModelsMachine2018; @pearlSevenToolsCausal2019]

::: {.colums layout-align="center"}

::: {.column width="45%" .fragment}
### Mechanistic models

::: {.callout}
- Inference-driven (causality).
- Great for small datasets.
- Knowledge beyond the observed data.

### Machine Learning

::: {.callout}
- Data-driven (prediction).
- Great for big data.
- Finds hidden knowledge in observed data.

1. Mechanistic Machine Learning **is not** domain-knowledge-aided feature engineering. You need a whole other model to complement the ML algorithm.

2. This isn't just ML ensemble; you must have an ML and a Mech model.

## MechML: Three strategies

	
::: {.fragment}
- **ML Correction**: Use machine learning to learn the errors of a mechanistic model.
:::

::: {.fragment}
- **Mechanistic Feature**: Add mechanistic predictions as a feature of a machine learning model.
:::

::: {.fragment}
- **Mechanistic Penalty**: Add constraints to the ML algorithm based on a mechanistic model.
